Energy Optimization Dashboard-

  This project showcases an Energy Optimization Dashboard developed during my internship as a Power BI Developer. The dashboard provides comprehensive analysis and visualization of power consumption for two industrial plants: SPM (KM550) and DEDCS (EQ-20). The primary objective is to monitor and optimize energy usage, identify inefficiencies, and promote sustainable energy practices.

*Project Overview-

  The dashboard offers insights into the power consumption patterns of devices connected within the two plants. By tracking various metrics, it helps in understanding energy usage trends and identifying opportunities for energy savings.

*Key Metrics-

Plant 1: For SPM (KM550):
  
  1.Daily Consumption (kWh)
  
  2.Weekly Consumption (kWh)
  
  3.Monthly Consumption (kWh)
  
  4.High State Consumption (kWh)
  
  5.Middle State Consumption (kWh)
    
  6.Low State Consumption (kWh)
  
  7.Total Consumption per Hour
  
  8.Percentage of Regenerated Energy per Hour

Plant 2: For DEDCS (EQ-20):

  All metrics from SPM (KM550) plus additional insights:
  
  1.Activation/Pulse Input Count per Hour
  
  2.Daily Operation Efficiency (kWh)
  
  3.Power Factor Variation (Daily Ineffectiveness <1)
  
  4.Hourly Voltage and Current Trend
  
  5.Daily Voltage and Current Trend
  
  6.CO₂ Emission (kgCO₂) per Hour and Daily

*Dashboard Features-

  1.Dynamic Visualization: Separate sheets for each plant, allowing users to navigate and focus on specific metrics.
  
  2.Energy Consumption Trends: Visual representation of daily, weekly, and monthly energy usage, helping to identify peaks and lows.
  
  3.Performance Insights: Metrics such as Power Factor Variation and Operation Efficiency provide a deeper understanding of operational effectiveness.
  
  4.Environmental Impact: CO₂ emissions data highlight the environmental footprint of each plant, promoting energy-efficient practices.

*Technologies and Tools Used-

1.Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

2.Power Query: For data transformation and preparation.

3.Excel: Initial data storage and management.

4.This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for energy management, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions.
